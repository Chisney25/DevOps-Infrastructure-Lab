Miracle Chisom Ikechukwu | Aspiring DevOps Engineer

Wroclaw, Poland

This repository serves as a Proof of Work for my journey into Cloud-Native engineering. It contains hands-on labs focused on automating infrastructure, containerizing applications, and implementing CI/CD best practices.

🏗️ Project Architecture
1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Tool: Terraform

Directory: /terraform/azure-network

Focus: Provisioning Azure Virtual Networks (VNETs), subnets, and Resource Groups.

Goal: Eliminating manual portal configuration through automated HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) templates.

2. Containerization & Orchestration
Tools: Docker, Helm, Kubernetes

Directory: /docker | /helm

Focus: Building optimized Dockerfiles for web services and managing deployment replicas via Helm charts.

Goal: Ensuring application portability and scalability across environments.

3. Automation & CI/CD
Tool: GitHub Actions

Directory: /.github/workflows

Focus: Automated linting of Bash scripts and documentation compliance audits.

Goal: Implementing "Shift-Left" security and automated quality gates.

4. Linux Scripting
Tool: Bash

Directory: /scripts

Focus: System health checks, memory monitoring, and service status verification.

🛠️ Technical Documentation
